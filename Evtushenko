## This Earth holds not uninteresting people

This Earth holds not uninteresting souls.

Their fates akin planets history -

Each planet is unique on its own,

And no other bears semblance to its mystery.

And should someone unheeded thus lived -

With his obscurity amicable seemed -

Amongst the people, he stood out, surround 

in his imperceptibility shroud.
